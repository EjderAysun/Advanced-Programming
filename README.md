## General Info
* The **theory lessons** given every week and other **related documents** are in the file of the _relevant week's file_.
* This repository has been created for the purpose of repeating and transferring what is learned in theory courses. It is also developed by adding other relevant documents related to the theory courses. The theory lessons are not added exactly, they are developed by me as adding and removing some information.

## Course Objectives[[1]](https://se.ieu.edu.tr/en/syllabus/type/read/id/SE+226)
The main objective of this course is to **improve programming skills** of students in multiple languages. Python and C++ languages will be used. Students will be exposed to commonly used **data structures**, **libraries**, **methodologies** and tools by experiencing them _first in theory_, _then in practical laboratory sessions_. Students will prepare a project that meets the requirements by applying methods given in the course.

## Learning Outcomes[[1]](https://se.ieu.edu.tr/en/syllabus/type/read/id/SE+226)
- _The students who succeeded in this course_;
  - **develop programs** in multiple languages,
  - **control the flow** in multiple programming languages,
  - **construct data structures** in multiple languages,
  - **define functions** in multiple languages,
  - **access data resources**,
  - build a program that meets requirements **using complex methods**, **structures** and **data resources**.

---
## Technologies
* C++ version (x86_64-posix-seh-rev0, Built by MinGW-W64 project) 8.1.0
* Python version 3.11.2
* Visual Studio Vode version 1.76.2

## Features
**You can find every theory document to the relevant weeks in the relevant week’s file and review, improve or use the lessons _under license terms_**.

## Status
In progress; related documents will be added almost weekly until the end of the 2023 Spring Semester, and past documents will be updated if necessary.  

~~On hold; development is paused for now~~

## Inspiration
Software Engineering 226 (SE 226) (Izmir University of Economics, 2023, SE 226 course, Spring Semester theory lessons)

As a student of the Izmir University of Economics, I create these notes and comments in accordance with the SE 226 theory lessons for the repeating and disseminating information of the SE 226 course in 2023.

The information has not been published exactly, it has been examined in detail by me, put into code, documented, and arranged in a way that is easier to understand.

I share documents publicly. The contents of the SE 226 projects that will be given in the future may be similar to this document. If you have an ethical responsibility based on this or a similar course, assignment, or task, please use this as an opinion only. If you have a question or need more information about the theory notes or codes, send an email to me: <ejderaysunn@gmail.com>
