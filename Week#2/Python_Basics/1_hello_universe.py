# In Python no (not always) need to store source code in a file â†’ INTERPRETED!

# Python Interpretation #
# - Python requires a piece of software called an interpreter.
# - The interpreter is the program you will need to run Python code and scripts.
# - The interpreter is able to run Python code in two different ways: \
#     1. As a script model.
#     2. As a piece of code typed into an interactive session \
#     (Three arrows is the prompt of the Python interpreter.)
